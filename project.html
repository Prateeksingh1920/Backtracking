    <p id="a">Backtracking</p>
    <p class="b">Backtracking is a form of recursion</p>
    <p class="b">The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of option,
        and you must choose one of these.After you make your choice you will get a new set of 
        options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. 
        This procedures is repeated over and over until you you reach a final state.If you 
        made a good sequence of choices; your final state is a goal state; if you didtn't, it istn't,<br>
        <br>
        Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good 
         leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that the leaves are all good or all bad.
         You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning with the root, you choose one of its children 
         to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf. <br>
         <br>
         Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your 
         most recent choice , and trying out the next option in that set of options . If you run out of options, revoke
         the choice that got you here, and try another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options
         left, there are no good leaves to be found. <br>
         <br>
         This needs an example <br><br>
         <img src="root.gif" alt="">  <br>
         <ol>
            <li class="b">Starting a Root, your options are A and B. You choose A</li>
            <li class="b">At A, your options are C and D. You choose C</li>
            <li class="b">C is bad. GO back to A</li>
            <li class="b">At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D</li>
            <li class="b">D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
            <li class="b">At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root</li>
            <li class="b">At Root, you have already tried a. Try B.</li>
            <li class="b">At B, your options are E and F.Try E.</li>
            <li class="b">E is good. Congratulations!</li>
         </ol>
    </p>
    <div class="ab">In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices we could make. 
        There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what choices we have.
         (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)</div>

            <div class="ab">Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. 
                This is essential to understanding the algorithm. 
                If solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes on a path from the root to some goal node. 
                We say that n is solvable. 
                If solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes n to any goal node.</div>

                    <li class="b">If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p class="b">Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable (part of a path to a goal node), 
                    all you have to do is test whether any child of n is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n.
                     In the above code, this is done by the lines</p>
                     <div class="ax">for each child c of n {<br>

                      return false{

                        <p class="b">Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. 
                            If the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable, if the leaf node is not a goal node, it is not solvable. 
                            This is our base case. In the above code, this is done by the lines</p>

                              <p>The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. 
                                You should understand it thoroughly. Another way of stating it is as follows:</p>

                                    <li class="b">If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node.</li>
                                    <li class="b">Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal node, or until you have searched them all unsuccessfully.</li>

                                <p class="b"><b>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</b></p>
                                <p class="b">Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm. 
                                    In fact, that is how your recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly language.</p>

                                      <p class="b">Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node currently on the top of the stack,
                                         and these are only pushed on one child at a time, 
                                         hence, the nodes on the stack at all times describe a valid path in the tree. 
                                         Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among their descendents.
                                          Therefore, if the root node gets removed (making the stack empty), there must have been no goal nodes at all,
                                           and no solution to the problem. <br><br>

                                        When the stack algorittim terminates successfully, 
                                        the nodes on the stack form (in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal node. <br><br>
                                        
                                        Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path information is embodied (in reverse order) in the sequence of recursive calls.
                                         Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a time, by (for instance) printing the node at the current level,
                                          or storing it in an array. <br> <br>

                                          <p class="b"><b>Keeping backtracking simple</b></p>
                                          <p class="b">All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem, they can get pretty cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex: <br><br>

                                            for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate solutions <br><br>
                                            
                                            To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods. In a chess game, for example, you could test whether a node is a leaf by writing a gameOver method (or you could even call it isLeaf ). This method would encapsulate all the ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain. <br><br>
                                            
                                            Notice that the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of its children have been tried already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made this look simple, by just saying for each child c of n. In reality, it may be difficult to figure out what the possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through them. In chess, for example, a node can represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of that node can represent the arrangement after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track of which ones you've already examined? <br><br>
                                            
                                            The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as follows: Upon initial entry to the node (that is, when you first get there from above), make a list of all its children. As you try each child, take it off the list. When. the list is empty, there are no remaining untried children, and you can return "failure." This is a simple approach, but it may require quite a lot of additional work. <br><br>
                                            
                                            There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if you can define an ordering on the children. If there is an ordering, and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which child to try next. <br><br>
                                            
                                            For example, you might be able to number the children 1 through n, and try them in numerical order. Then, if you have just tried child k, you know that you have already tried children 1 through k-1, and you have not yet tried children k+1 through n. Or, if you are trying to color a map with just four colors, you can always try red first, then yellow, then green, then blue. If child yellow fails, you know to try child green next. If you are searching a maze, you can try choices in the order left, straight, right (or perhaps north, east, south, west). <br><br>
                                            
                                            It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node. In the chess game example, you might number your pieces (or perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical order, but in addition each piece may also have several moves, and these must also be ordered.

Each node can reference (point to) zero, one, or two other nodes, which are called its children. The children are referred to as the left child and/or the right child. All nodes are reachable (by one or more steps) from the root node, and there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not part of the definition of a binary tree, we will say that a node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The first example in this paper (which we repeat here) shows a binary tree. <br><br>

Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we need to fall back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of print statements. These tricks can be applied to any program, but are especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines. <br><br>

You probably want to print, for each method, what parameters it came in with, and what value it leaves with. However, if you just print a long. list of these, it's hard to match up method exits with their corresponding entries. Indenting to show the level of nesting can help. <br><br>

Often it's as much work to debug the debugging statements as it is to debug the actual program. Once your program is working, why throw this code away? <br><br>

You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a lot of work. What's more, in the above example, you would have to replace every retum(yes (node)) with return(true), and every returnino(node)} with retum false. With all these changes, you might introduce new bugs into your program <br><br>

Hence to find the children of a node (that is, of a board position), we need only find the possible moves from that node. Remember that it is also highly desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves. <br><br>

To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent. Probably a number of approaches would work, and what follows is based on the way I worked it out. If you were to program this puzzle, you might find a different but equally valid approach <br><br>
                                                                                                            
                                                                                                            First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it can move ahead one square, then it cannot jump. If it can jump, it cannot move ahead one square. This suggests that, to find the possible moves, we might assign numbers to the marbles, and check each marble in turn. When we have looked at all the marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require having a table to keep track of where each marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the board each time to find the marble we want. Neither alternative is very attractive <br><br>
                                                                                                            
                                                                                                            Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a unique space. Hence, instead of talking about moving a particular marble, we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space. If a move is possible from a given space, then that must be the only move possible from that space, because if the marble in that space has a move, it is unique. There is a slight complication because not every space contains a marble, but at least the spaces (unlike the marbles) stay in one place. <br><br>

Just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the board. For each space, either zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a boolean method canMove(int[] board, int position) which determines whether a move is possible from the given position:</p>
